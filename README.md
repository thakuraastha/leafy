# Plant Care App

This is a simple Python application that provides plant care tips based on the user's input. The app allows users to enter the name of a plant and select a care task (watering, fertilizing, pruning, or sunlight) to get tips on how to take care of the plant.

## Prerequisites

This app requires Python 3 and the Tkinter module, which is included in most Python installations. If you do not have Python 3 installed, you can download it from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

## Installation and Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the code as a ZIP file.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the code is located.
3. Run the following command to launch the app:
```
python plant_care_app.py
```
4. Enter the name of a plant and select a care task from the dropdown menu.
5. Click the "Get care tips" button to display the plant care tips.

## Customization

You can customize the app by modifying the code and adding new features. Here are some possible modifications:

- Add more care tasks and corresponding tips.
- Retrieve the plant care tips from a database or an API instead of hard-coding them in the app.
- Display the care tips in a message box or a label instead of printing them in the console.
